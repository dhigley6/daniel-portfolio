              'My research focussed on the development of new X-ray characterization techniques using LCLS, a large-scale X-ray experimentation facility. Due to the nature of this work, I spent the majority of my time analyzing and visualizing data with Python as well as communicating the results to stakeholders.<br><br>'
              + '-Developed and validated a regularized maximum likelihood estimation algorithm for signal deconvolution to simplify and increase the sensitivity of a common X-ray spectroscopy (report: arxiv.org/abs/2006.10914 code: github.com/dhigley6/PAX2). The algorithm is implemented as a custom scikit-learn estimator and uses cross validation to select the degree of regularization.<br><br>'
              + '-Led three large-scale experiments (10 people per team) and analyzed the Terabytes of image and time series data each experiment produced. One experiment demonstrated how to increase the efficiency by more than a million times of a common X-ray characterization technique.<br><br>'
              + '-Developed software and instrumentation enabling high resolution and accuracy femtosecond time- and polarization-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The software produces and shows diagnostic information on actively accumulating data using a distributed computing system. This technology has since been used by several different teams, resulting in publications in top journals.<br><br>'
              + '-Rapidly analyzed data for more than 18 several-day-long experiments at large-scale scientific facilities (analysis deadlines ranged from an hour to a day after data collection). Experiments focussed on understanding ultrafast dynamics in materials that could be used in better computers and resulted in more than 10 publications as a co-author.<br><br>'
